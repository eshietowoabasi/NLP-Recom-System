# API reference

Base path: `/api`. JSON in and out, except document uploads (multipart) and
report downloads (files).

**Authentication.** Sign in with `POST /api/auth/login`. The session is kept in
an `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax` cookie that lasts 8 hours (`Secure` in
production). Browsers must send state-changing requests from the app's own
origin; others are refused with `403 CSRF_ORIGIN_MISMATCH`.

**Roles** (spec §14):
- **Admin:** everything.
- **Curriculum Planner** ("Planner" below): upload documents, create and run
  sessions, and review, map and report on their own sessions. Planners can
  read every session but only change their own.

"Owner" means the user who created the session.

**Errors** always have this shape:

```json
{"success": false, "error": {"code": "VALIDATION_ERROR", "message": "…", "details": {"field": "problem"}}}
```

| HTTP | Typical codes |
|---|---|
| 401 | `UNAUTHORIZED`, `INVALID_CREDENTIALS` |
| 403 | `FORBIDDEN`, `CSRF_ORIGIN_MISMATCH` |
| 404 | `NOT_FOUND` |
| 409 | `CONFLICT`, `DUPLICATE_DOCUMENT`, `DOCUMENT_IN_USE`, `SESSION_NOT_RUNNABLE`, `SESSION_PROCESSING`, `NO_CORE_REFERENCE`, `RESULTS_NOT_READY`, `NOT_PARSED`, `NOT_ACCEPTED`, `MAPPING_EXISTS`, `COURSE_CODE_IN_USE`, `USER_EXISTS` |
| 413 | `PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE` |
| 415 | `UNSUPPORTED_FILE_TYPE` |
| 422 | `VALIDATION_ERROR`, `JUSTIFICATION_REQUIRED` |
| 429 | `ACCOUNT_LOCKED` (5 failed logins within 15 minutes) |
| 503 | `QUEUE_UNAVAILABLE` |

**Pagination.** List endpoints take `?page=` and `?per_page=` (at most 100)
and return
`{"items": [...], "pagination": {"page", "per_page", "total", "pages"}}`.

## Health and authentication

| Method | Path | Access | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/health` | public | `{"status": "ok", "database": "ok"}`; returns 503 if the database is down |
| POST | `/api/auth/login` | public | `{"username", "password", "remember"?}` returns `{"user"}` |
| POST | `/api/auth/logout` | signed in | |
| GET | `/api/auth/me` | signed in | The current user |
| GET | `/api/dashboard/summary` | signed in | Document and session counts, recent sessions, your pending reviews, `core_reference_available` |

## Documents (§7)

| Method | Path | Access | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/documents` | signed in | Filters: `source_category`, `status` (`Uploaded`, `Parsed`, `Failed`), `q` (title search), `mine=1` |
| POST | `/api/documents` | Planner, Admin | Multipart: `file` (PDF/DOCX/TXT/CSV, ≤ 20 MB), `source_category`, optional `title`. Parsed immediately; returns 201 with `processing_status` `Parsed` or `Failed` plus `error_message`. Only Admins may use `NUC Core Reference`. |
| GET | `/api/documents/{id}` | signed in | Metadata |
| GET | `/api/documents/{id}/text` | signed in | `?view=raw\|clean` |
| DELETE | `/api/documents/{id}` | uploader or Admin | Returns 409 if the document is used by a session that is processing |

Source categories: `NUC Core Reference`, `Job Market Data`,
`Institutional Document`, `Policy Document`, `Academic Literature`.

## Analysis sessions (§6, §15)

| Method | Path | Access | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/sessions` | signed in | Filters: `status`, `mine=1` |
| GET | `/api/sessions/defaults` | signed in | The `parameter_config` a new session gets when fields are left out (built-in defaults, then `DEFAULT_OVERLAP_THRESHOLD`/`DEFAULT_TOPIC_COUNT` from the environment, then the Admin's saved NLP defaults) |
| POST | `/api/sessions` | Planner, Admin | See the example below |
| GET | `/api/sessions/{id}` | signed in | Includes `document_ids`, `progress {stage, step, total_steps}`, `pipeline_info` (models, timings, counts, warnings) |
| DELETE | `/api/sessions/{id}` | owner or Admin | Not allowed while processing |
| POST | `/api/sessions/{id}/run` | owner or Admin | **202**; runs in the background. Allowed only from `Pending` or `Failed`, and needs a parsed NUC Core Reference in the library. |

```json
POST /api/sessions
{"session_name": "2026 Computing Curriculum Review",
 "document_ids": [12, 15, 19],
 "parameter_config": {"similarity_threshold": 0.80, "ner_weight": 0.40, "topic_weight": 0.35,
                      "novelty_weight": 0.25, "max_recommendations": 20, "topic_count": 10}}
```

`parameter_config` is optional; unset values come from
`GET /api/sessions/defaults`. The weights must sum to 1.0.
`max_recommendations` is 1–100 and `topic_count` (the most BERTopic themes to
keep, passed as `nr_topics`) is 2–100. A session can contain 1–50 documents, all `Parsed`.

The progress stages are `queued`, `parsing`, `preprocessing`, `keywords`,
`entities`, `embeddings`, `topics`, `overlap`, `scoring` and `saving`. A run
whose worker stops reporting for `STALE_RUN_MINUTES` (default 30) is marked
`Failed` automatically and can be retried. A run is also stopped and marked
`Failed` once it passes `PIPELINE_SOFT_TIME_LIMIT` seconds (default 900,
i.e. 15 minutes).

## NLP results (session must be `Completed`, otherwise 409 `RESULTS_NOT_READY`)

| Method | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/sessions/{id}/results` | Everything: `pipeline_info`, the corpus output, and the output for each document |
| GET | `/api/sessions/{id}/keywords` | TF-IDF `corpus_keywords` `[{term, score, document_frequency}]` and keywords per document |
| GET | `/api/sessions/{id}/entities` | `skill_demand` `[{text, label, mentions, document_frequency, document_ids}]` and entities per document. `?label=TECHNOLOGY\|SKILL\|METHODOLOGY\|ORG\|PRODUCT\|GPE` |
| GET | `/api/sessions/{id}/topics` | BERTopic topics `[{topic_id, label, keywords, size, distinct_passages, relevance, representative_passages, document_counts, source_category_counts}]` and topic shares per document |
| GET | `/api/sessions/{id}/similarity` | `similarity_threshold`, `core_document_ids`, and for each recommendation `max_similarity`, `novelty_score`, `overlap_status`, `core_matches`. A similarity **at or above** the threshold is a *Potential Duplicate*. |

All of these are available to any signed-in user.

## Recommendations (§10, §13.1)

| Method | Path | Access | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/sessions/{id}/recommendations` | signed in | Ranked. Filters: `overlap_status`, `decision` (`Accepted`, `Rejected` or `pending`), `include_evidence=1` |
| GET | `/api/recommendations/{id}` | signed in | Includes `evidence`: topic, keywords, passages, documents, skills and `core_matches` |
| PATCH | `/api/recommendations/{id}` | owner or Admin | `{"topic_title"?, "topic_description"?}` |
| PATCH | `/api/recommendations/{id}/decision` | owner or Admin | `{"decision": "Accepted"\|"Rejected"\|null, "notes"?}`; `null` undoes a decision. Accepting a *Potential Duplicate* requires notes (422 `JUSTIFICATION_REQUIRED`). While a mapping exists, the decision can't change (409 `MAPPING_EXISTS`). |

```json
{"rec_id": 55, "rank": 1, "topic_title": "Cloud Computing and Kubernetes",
 "topic_description": "Theme found in 24 passages across 3 source document(s)…",
 "ner_score": 0.96, "topic_score": 1.0, "novelty_score": 0.92, "composite_score": 0.96,
 "max_similarity": 0.08, "overlap_status": "No Significant Overlap",
 "planner_decision": null, "planner_notes": null}
```

## Curriculum mapping (§16)

| Method | Path | Access | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/recommendations/{id}/mapping` | signed in | `items`: the recommendation's mapping (zero or one) |
| POST | `/api/recommendations/{id}/mapping` | owner or Admin | The recommendation must be Accepted. Body below; returns 201. A recommendation maps to exactly one course: a second POST returns 409 `MAPPING_EXISTS` with the existing `map_id` (edit it with PUT instead). |
| GET | `/api/mappings/{id}` | signed in | |
| PUT | `/api/mappings/{id}` | owner or Admin | Same body as POST |
| DELETE | `/api/mappings/{id}` | owner or Admin | |
| GET | `/api/sessions/{id}/mappings` | signed in | Every mapping in a session, ordered by course code |

```json
{"course_code": "CSC 413", "course_title": "Cloud Infrastructure and DevOps", "credit_units": 3,
 "prerequisites": ["CSC 201"], "learning_outcomes": ["Deploy containerised services on a public cloud"]}
```

Course codes are normalised (`csc413` becomes `CSC 413`; an institution
prefix is allowed, so `uuy-csc411` becomes `UUY-CSC 411`) and must be unique
within a session. Credit units must be 1, 2 or 3. Each mapping needs 1–12
learning outcomes and up to 8 prerequisites.

## Reports (§16)

| Method | Path | Access | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/sessions/{id}/reports` | Planner, Admin | `{"format": "pdf"\|"docx"}` (default pdf); returns 201 |
| GET | `/api/reports` | signed in | History. `?session_id=` filter. |
| GET | `/api/reports/{id}` | signed in | Metadata |
| GET | `/api/reports/{id}/download` | signed in | The file |

## Administration (Admin only)

| Method | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/admin/users` | `?q=` searches username and email |
| POST | `/api/admin/users` | `{"username", "email", "password" (≥ 8 chars), "role"?}`; `role` is `Admin` or `Curriculum Planner` (the default) |
| PATCH | `/api/admin/users/{id}` | Any of `role`, `is_active`, `email`, `password`. You can't demote or deactivate yourself. |
| GET | `/api/admin/settings/nlp-defaults` | The system-wide defaults for new sessions (`similarity_threshold`, weights, `max_recommendations`, `topic_count`) |
| PUT | `/api/admin/settings/nlp-defaults` | Any subset of those fields; validated like `parameter_config`. Audited as `SETTINGS_UPDATE`. |
| GET | `/api/admin/audit` | Filters: `user_id`, `action_type`, `entity_type`, `from`, `to` (ISO dates) |
